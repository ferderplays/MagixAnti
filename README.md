# MagixAnti
Anticheat for your minecraft server!
MagixSK made an anticheat, that is terrible to work, so i will be rewriting it. Also i will make it more code-viewable and easier to understand.
# edit:
i just found out, it is in .yml
so i will completely rewrite it.
# also:
it would just log, if a player has the banned folders, instead of banning the player, cause i myself waas playing legit on Magixs servers, and i got banned for having banned files in my .minecraft folder

# how to bypass:
simply just make your hack client create folder anywhere outside .minecraft folder. could be in "user.home" directory("user.home" is a property for it)
